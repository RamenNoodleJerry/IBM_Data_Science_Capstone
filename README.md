**Context:**
SpaceXâ€™s Falcon9 rocket can recover its first stage rocket, the most expensive rocket part, after sending the payload into the orbit, saving 50%+ launching cost.
If we can accurately predict whether the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. 

**Question:**
What are some important features to consider when launching a rocket?
What models can best predict rocket launch?

This research will utilize past Falcon9 launch data and apply various visualization, machine learning techniques to give a prediction of Falcon9 landing success rate.

**Steps:**
1. Data collection using REST API and Beautiful Soup Webscrapping
2. Data Cleaning
3. Exploratory Data Analysis and SQL analysis
4. Data Visualization
5. Interactive visual analytics using Folium Map and Plotly Dash
6. Predictive analysis using classification models
